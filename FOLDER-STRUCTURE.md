### Folder Structure:

1. **`README.md`**: Contains information about the project, including how to set it up, dependencies, and other relevant details.

2. **`node_modules/`**: This directory contains all the project's dependencies installed via Node Package Manager (npm) or Yarn.

3. **`package.json`**: A file that includes project metadata and a list of dependencies. It also includes scripts for tasks like running the development server, building the project, and more.

4. **`public/`**: This folder contains static assets that won't be processed by Webpack or other build tools. The `index.html` file, which is the main HTML file for your React application, is located here.

5. **`src/`**: This is where most of the development occurs. It houses all the source code of the React application.

   - **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application where the React app is rendered into the DOM.
   - **`App.js`**: The main component that represents the overall structure of the app. Other components are typically imported and used within `App.js`.
   - **`components/`**: This folder contains reusable React components that make up the UI. Each component is usually in its own file.
   - **`assets/`**: Contains static assets like images, fonts, or styles used in the application.

     - **`images/`**: Contains images used in the application.
     - **`styles/`**: Contains CSS files or stylesheets for styling components.

   - **`utils/`**: Holds utility functions, constants, or helper files used across the application.
   - **`services/`**: External services, API calls, data fetching functions
   - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components
   - **`containers/`**: Higher-level components that interact with state and pass props to other components
   - **`pages/`**: Top-level components representing different pages/routes of the app


### Description

#### Components and Containers Separation

- Components: Reusable, small, and focused on rendering UI.
- Containers: Handle logic, state management, and pass data to components.

#### Services Layer

- Keep API calls and data-fetching logic separate in a services layer for easier testing and maintenance.
